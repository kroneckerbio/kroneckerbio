%               The name of the compartment in which this species resides
%           .InitialValue [ cell matrix ]
%               This matrix is ? by 2. Each row is a string followed by a
%               nonnegative scalar. The string represents one seed and the
%               scalar represents the amount that the seed contributes to
%               this state's initial value.
%       .Reactions [ struct vector ]
%           Each reaction is elementary, no reaction in this vector
%           corresponds to both the forward and reverse reverse of a
%           reversible reaction.
%           .Name [ string ]
%               The name of the reaction. This can be empty and is only

%               Each string corresponds to the full name a specific species
%               that is a reactant in this reaction. If a string is
%               empty, it means that no species takes part.
%           .Products [ cell vector 1 by 2 of strings ]
%               Each string corresponds to the full name a specific species
%               that is a product of this reaction. If a string is

%               The first element is a string name of the kinetic parameter
%               associated with this reaction. The second element is a

%               reaction.

%           .Name [ string ]
%               The name of the output
%           .Expressions [ cell vector of regexp strings | '' ]
%               The regular expressions match species of the model. Each
%               species whose full name contains the described substring
%               contributes to the output an amount equal to the
%               corresponding element in Values. An empty string means
%               that the value is constituitive (the output simply has
%               that value regardless of any species value).
%           .Values [ nonnegative vector ]
%               The value of the output is the sum of each value in
%               this vector times the sum of the amounts of each species
%               that is matched by Expressions.

%           This function handle allows the parameter values of the model

%           counterparts. The structure returned is a mass action Kronecker
%           model identical to the one to which Update is attached except
%           that the parameter values have been changed and the appropriate
%           matrices and function handles have been updated.
